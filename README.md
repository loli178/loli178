### Hi there 👋
Hello! My name is Lorena Alibertti and I am a Full Stack Developer from Argentina. I have a strong passion for programming and I am always seeking to improve my skills in languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJs, Redux, React and SQL. Currently, I am studying for a degree in Information Systems of Organizations and Economics at the University of Buenos Aires, and also completing a Full Stack Web Developer program at Henry, where I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant. Prior to my career in programming, I worked in the areas of administration, finance, and accounting. I am looking for new challenges in the web development field where I can apply my knowledge and skills while continuing to learn and grow professionally.
